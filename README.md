###### ðŸ‘¾ How to play

You control the alien character with the help of your keyboard. The character movement is bound to regular keyboard movement keys, W - forward, A- left, D- right. Tap the mouse on screen to shoot bullets. Use the spacebar to jump.You must navigate through a vast map full of different kinds of enemies. The enemies you might encounter include: Flamey (shoots at you with a breath of fire), Frosty (throws razor sharp ice shards at you), Slimy (regurgitates poison laden gases which can choke you to death), Robbit (performs an earth shattering stomp which can knock you off).

You have one mode of defense against the unfriendly creatures, Blasters. You can press the space key on your keyboard to shoot your super power abilities. Blasters are powerful projectiles that shoot like lasers. Your enemies don't die however, they are left encumbered for a moment before recovering, which you can see by the stun bar above their heads. Run away quickly before they wake up again!

Once the player manages to get to the end of the pathway, they are teleported to a procedurally generated maze. The player must navigate through this maze, once again laden with enemies. At the center of the maze lies the missing part of your ship which you must retrieve. This maze is different every time, so every playthrough will be a fresh challenge.

Upon retrieving the key, the player must make it back to the ship and encounter much more challenging enemies (theyâ€™re huge flying bats) which follows the player around and rains down a hailstorm of fiery rocks at them. The player cannot defend themselves, they can only hope to run to safety. When the player gets back to their ship they are able to jump start their way back home.
